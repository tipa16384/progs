1) Introduction                                                          [intr]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to my Bestiary FAQ for FFVI Advance. A lot of questions have been
showing up on the Message Boards about different Bestiary questions. This FAQ
is here to answer those questions (eventually).

Take note that I am not a FF fanatic or anything. FFVI was the first FF game I
played (on SNES), and to date it is still the only FF game I've played. I just
felt someone should make a Bestiary FAQ for this newly released game, and why
not me?

2) Version History                                                       [vers]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.0 (6/3/08): (671 KB)
- Finally decided to make this v1.0. I figured it's complete and accurate for
  the most part. Any additions will just be a few extra things.
- IN THIS UPDATE: Provided more exact locations for every monster except for
  Dragon's Den (and those may be as exact as I can get them, but I haven't
  gotten there to see for myself yet)
- Things I will eventually add: Rage Packs
- If you find any other errors, let me know, thanks

v0.995 (2/11/08): (671 KB)
- Added more exact location for everything minus the bonus dungeons
- Fixed a few Rage mistakes
- STILL TO DO: Fix AI scripts (few mistakes)

v0.99 (11/26/07): (669 KB)
- By request of MetricTrout, I have now added a new section 7 which lists  
  every single Palette Swap in the game
- Added the Palette Swaps section for those interested in that (Thx again to
  MetricTrout for the suggestion)
- Updated Location names to make them more exact

v0.985 (11/14/07): (662 KB)
- Added another line under "Status Immunity" to show all the status' monsters
  ARE vulnerable to (basically the opposite of Status Immunity). Figured this
  might be pretty helpful since it's hard to tell which status' you CAN inflict
  monsters with

v0.98 (10/2/07): (621 KB)
- Added Battle Scripts for every single monster entry!
- Fixed Humbaba mix-ups again (should be correct now)
- Added some more info on the Unlisted Monsters

v0.97 (9/26/07): (397 KB)
- Fixed a small error concerning Ultros' steal item during the Airship battle
  (Thx Steve J for this)
- Updated several locations for the enemies to make more exact. Locations are
  all 100% accurate up to the point where I'm at in my guide.
- Added "Special Attacks" for each monster. Thx to Djibriel for reminding me
  to do this :P Also, Djibriel pointed out a few other errors that are now
  fixed
- Edited Missable list some more to make it more complete
- Fixed a Metamorphose listing error (Thx to genkaku666 for pointing this out)
- As always, if you find any more errors, keep those e-mails coming. I'm
  getting less and less e-mails about mistakes, so that either means there
  aren't that many mistakes left, or no one is finding them. Hopefully, it's
  the former.

v0.96 (9/12/07): (377 KB)
- Extended the list of Missable Monsters. No one should ever complain about
  missing anymore monsters because they weren't listed here.
- The regular Missable Monsters list includes everything that I've done in my
  walkthrough, so it may still be incomplete on some areas I haven't done yet.

v0.95 (8/9/07): (375 KB)
- Fixed some Humbaba mix-ups
- Fixed other random errors

v0.9 (5/2/07): (375 KB)
- Fixed a couple more errors with monsters that had similar/duplicate names
- Fixed quite a few other errors that didn't display some info (fixed now)
- Fixed some confusion on Humbaba (had me confused for a while, too)
- Should be getting close to 100% accuracy... let me know if you think you have
  found an error
- Have added a little more info on the unlisted monsters (Check out the Note
  for #23, #24, and #25) and corrected Chadarnook's entry in same section
- Provided exact locations some WoR monsters (basically, all the monsters I've
  encountered up to 4.90 in my walkthrough). Monsters will be added as I get
  closer to finishing my walkthrough
- Added a few more Status Immunities (Thx assassin17)
  
v0.8 (4/14/07): (373 KB)
- Just letting you know I'm still around
- Added Slow and Stop Status Immunities to all that it applied too
- With the addition of the above, I believe every piece of info you find in
  here is 100% correct (the only thing that MAY be incorrect is Slow/Stop
  Status Immunities for the Unlisted Monsters, but they shouldn't matter too
  much)
- Added two monsters to the Missable Monsters section (#90 and #91). Thx to
  Vlederane for (indirectly) bringing it to my attention
- One or two typos here and there

v0.7 (3/20/07): (370 KB)
- Last update for a while (unless there are mistakes)
- Added Control Commands for each monster
- Added Sketch Attacks for each monster
- Fixed all the Steal/Drops that were listed as None. This affected 45 Steals
  and 17 Drops, so it's nice to get that fixed.
- Updated the Unlisted Monsters section to have all the same info that listed
  monsters have
- If anyone has any other suggestions what else to add in here, let me know
  I've run out of ideas

v0.6 (3/19/07): (335 KB)
- Didn't I promise more updates? :p
- Changed Section 4 to list Missable Monster. Be sure to check it out
- Added the SNES Names for each monster
- Finally added the Speed stat. The in-game Bestiary doesn't list this for
  some reason, but thx to joshua_g's hacking, I got the data and have it listed
- Added the steal/drop rates directly into each monster listing
- Added commas in between Immunities and such (just makes it look nicer)
- Re-Organized a lot AGAIN, so I can update EVEN faster. Again, nothing changes
  for you, but it makes it a LOT easier on me. Go me.

v0.5 (3/18/07): (305 KB)
- Added (Forgotten) Locations for Satellite (#39) and Apparition (#47)
- Added Rages if a monster had them
- Added ALL locations for EVERY monster in WoB only! (1-113) There's still only
  at least one location for all WoR monsters.
- Added more detail to Monster Locations (most notable in Magitek Research
  Facility and Cave to Sealed Gate)
- Re-Organized a lot of the Bestiary. This doesn't affect what you guys see,
  but now I can update anything to the Bestiary MUCH faster (This also means
  more updates)

v0.4 (2/14/07): (299 KB)
- Now there's at least one location for every single Bestiary Entry
- Added the 2nd part of Chadarnook
- Added (hopefully) every enemy not listed in Bestiary, along with stats.

v0.3 (2/11/07): (259 KB)
- Added locations for ALL World of Balance Monsters (1-113 and 276-308)
- Added all the monsters (that I know about) that don't have Bestiary entries

v0.2 (2/10/07): (249 KB)
- Fixed Monster #112 (Data had shifted and was slightly messed up)
- Fixed a typo for #76 (Had mispelled Sergeant)
- Fixed a typo for #262 (Had mispelled Prometheus)
- Added loads of info for each monster (Huge thanks to Josh for this)
- Added data for Kaiser Dragon & Kefka (if anyone can confirm these, it'd be
  greatly appreciated)

v0.1 (2/8/07): (166 KB)
- Added all 384 enemies the game lists
- Submitted first version

This section used to be the "Help Request" section a long time ago. I warned
in the last couple versions that I would change this section, and here it is.

Here I will list all the monsters you can miss permanently. This section is
still rather underdeveloped, but expect it to be more detailed and expand
in future updates.

As of now, I will only list the monsters you can miss in WoB (and a few in WoR,
I apologize for the list not being complete for WoR yet).

Some people may think the list is missing many monsters. Take note that if you
think a monster is missable, but it's not on this list, that you can find in
the Soul Shrine (dungeon at end of game).

NOTE: I shouldn't have to say this, but I will anyway. If you're past the
section listed after the monster name, you have MISSED that monster and have
no way of EVER getting the Bestiary entry in your current playthrough.

NOTE2: The list of Missable Monsters is now split up into two lists. The first
list pretty much remains the same, specifying in monsters that are easily
missed while playing through the game. The second list contains the monsters
that you should have in your Bestiary BEFORE YOU HEAD TO THE FLOATING CONTINENT.
The monsters in the second list are monsters that you should have gotten during
random encounters, but if for some reason you didn't, you won't be able to find
them after you finish the first half of the game.

MAKE SURE TO HAVE THESE MONSTERS BEFORE GOING TO THE FLOATING CONTINENT:

NOTE: The locations for all these monsters are further down in the guide.

Again, these monsters are mostly easy to find. However, if you're unlucky,
you may never encounter (for example) a Darkwind. People have gotten angry that
they missed enemies like Darkwind because I did not list them as missable. So
now, with this list, no one should be missing any more monsters.

7. Leaf Bunny
8. Darkwind
9. Sand Ray
10. Alacran
14. Belmodar

XX. Specter [Listed only for Rage purposes. Has no Bestiary entry]
XX. Eukaryote [Listed only for Rage purposes. Has no Bestiary entry]

5) Bestiary                                                              [bstr]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a complete list of every Bestiary entry in the game.

Now on to the explanation of everything in each entry. Each stat itself should
be fairly obvious (Level, HP, MP, Attack..., Magic Evasion).

----------------------------------------
SNES Name - The name the monster had in the SNES version of the game
----------------------------------------
Location - Where to find a monster. I have listed every location for the WoB
monster. For now, there's still only one location for the WoR monsters.
----------------------------------------
Gil - Money
----------------------------------------
EXP - Experience
----------------------------------------
Steal - Each monster can have up to two items you can steal from it. The chance
of actually getting the item is listed behind each item (either 1/8, 7/8, or
Always).

NOTE: There is a seperate Steal formula to determine if you even have a chance
of stealing. If it turns out you do have a chance, THEN there's a 1/8, or 7/8
chance of you stealing.
----------------------------------------
Drops - Almost the same as Steal. Each monster can have up to two Drop items.
The chance of getting each item is listed behind it.

There is no drop formula like there is with steal, so you do in fact have a
1/8 or 7/8 chance of getting the items.
----------------------------------------
Elemental Immunity - Obvious. Monster is immune to the listed elements.
----------------------------------------
Weak Against - The monster's weakness(es)
----------------------------------------
Absorbs - The monster absorbs these types of spells
----------------------------------------
Type - Monster's Type. Either Humanoid, Undead, neither, or both
----------------------------------------
Status Immunity - The monster is immune to the listed status ailments
----------------------------------------
Vulnerable to - Shows which status ailments monsters are vulnerable to (simply
the exact opposite of the Status Immunity above)
----------------------------------------
Inherent Status - The monster automatically has these statuses.
----------------------------------------
Other Immunity - Just like it says, other immunities
----------------------------------------
Special Attack - Lists the Special Attack of the monster and the effects of the
                 attack
----------------------------------------
Rage - This is the Rage Gau can learn of each monster. Note that there is only
one thing listed here. However, when you use a Rage in Battle, you have a 50%
of doing a physical attack, and the other 50% of doing the Rage listed here.
This is true for every single Rage, which is why I didn't see the need to list
the physical attack. Know that you only have a 50% of doing the Rage that is
listed. If a monster has no Rage, there will be no Rage entry.
----------------------------------------
Sketch - This is the different attacks Relm will do when she uses Sketch on a
monster. The rate of each attack are listed behind each attack
----------------------------------------
Control - All the commands a monster will have if you Control it (Equip Fake
Mustache on Relm to be able to use Control)
----------------------------------------
Metamorphose - This is only for the Esper Ragnarok. When you use the Esper, the
game randomly selects one of the four items listed. The numbers in parenthese
indicates the chance of success (128/256 = 50%, 192/256 = 75%). 0/256 means it
will never succeed.
----------------------------------------
MP Kill - If it says Yes, the monster can be killed by draining it's MP
(bringing it down to 0). If it says No, it doesn't.
----------------------------------------
Imp Criticals - Only applies if you use the Imp spell on the monster. If Yes,
the monster will not lose any Attack when Imp'd, and will also do critical
hits on each physical attack.
----------------------------------------
Run Difficulty - Obvious, the difficulty of running from this monster. Only used
in a formula to determine if you successfully run from a battle or not.
----------------------------------------
Attack Visual - This is only used internally by the game to determine the
graphic and sound to show/play when the monster attacks.
----------------------------------------
AI Script - Shows what actions/attacks each monster does and when. Couple things
to note:
a) Obviously, if a monster has two turns listed, it will simply loop back to the
   beginning (i.o.w., 1st Turn) after all the turns are executed
b) When it says "Attacked by 'XXXX'", the XXXX refers to the battle command in
   game (i.e. "If attacked by 'Attack'" only applies to the Attack command).
   NOTE: I had to mention this because some people thought the 'Attack' meant
   any attack in the game
c) If a monster has two different counterattacks (i.e. Aepyornis counters with
   Attack if attacked by "Attack", and counters with !Featherdust for anything
   else), it will only do the first counter it comes across (i.o.w. attacking
   Aepyornis with the Attack command will not make Aepyornis use !Featherdust,
   as it has already countered with Attack; if it misses (Aepyornis only
   counters with Attack 33% of the time), it still won't counter with
   !Featherdust
d) All attacks pre-fixed with an exclamation mark ('!') are that monster's
   Special Attack (idea borrowed from Djibriel)
----------------------------------------

NOTE: Thanks to MetricTrout for suggesting this. This section exists because
of him.

8) Frequently Asked Questions                                            [faqs]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Question: How can I search for enemies?

Answer: Just use CTRL+F and type in the enemy's name and you should jump to
the enemie's info.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Question: What if I just know the number, and not the name?

Answer: Simple. Use CTRL+F and type in the number, followed by a period and a
space. So if trying to find monster 213, you hit CTRL+F and type in "213. "

You don't really have to put the space, but it's a more accurate search which
guarantees better results. If you leave it off, you'll still find the enemy
though.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Question: What about locations?

Answer: I have listed every location for every World of Balance monster so far.
Future updates will complete the list and include every single location for
every monster.

You could also just throw it on the FFVI Message Board somewhere, I'll probably

Acknowledgements:

HUGE thanks to:

AdirianSoan - For (indirectly) showing me a mistake which involved Devil Fist
              and Devil having the same locations.

assassin17 - For pointing out that Haste, Reflect, Safe, and Shell status
             immunities were missing

DAMIDDLEFINGER - Providing the first 70 or so monsters in an organized fashion

Djibriel - Notifying me of several errors and suggesting I add Special Attack
           for each monster, which I've finally done as of v0.97.

genkaku666 - Thx for pointing out a few errors which are now fixed.

joshua_g (Josh) - Everything you see under Status Immunity in every entry was
                  provided by Josh. Also explained several things to me that
                  I didn't know

MetricTrout - Without him, the "Palette Swaps" section wouldn't exist.

Reptobismol - Gave me the colors of the different Glutturns and what each of
              them demands

Terence - Battle scripts of Kaiser Dragon and Omega Weapon were done by Terence

Vlederane - For posting a topic on the FFVIA GameFAQs message board which made
            me realize that Antares (#90) and (#91) Lich are actually missable

www.rpglegion.com - This site was a tremendous help while doing the Battle
                    Scripts. I would not have been able to do all of them
                    without refering to this site several times.

Everyone else who's e-mailed me with locations
