<p>
A farmer along the way warned me of swine from beyond the grave,
but those accursed fields held no attraction for me (though the
stableboy had a nice turn of chin). The weather had me nearly
forgetting my search for dear Ahmid. When I returned to Ludlow,
the finery I was able to
purchase with my bits of silver and copper garnered in the
defense of Prydwen Keep more than lifted my mood. The dyemaster
colored my armor in the family colors of red and gold, and I even
had enough left to order a fancy gown from the seamstress, should I
ever be asked to court.

<p>
Young cutpurses and spriggarns harried the

farmers in the fields, and I was enlisted to help clear out that nest
of scoundrels. More than once, my spirit was released to the Ludlow marker,
but the bandits could not long stand against the united townspeople. When I reported
to my roguish master to receive more training, he said I had learned all he
had to teach, and now I would have to choose a different path; would I train as
a scout, whose skill lies in stealth? Or that of an infiltrator, who strikes
deep into enemy territory? Or perhaps my path lied in the minstrelry,
strengthening those near me with the power of magical song.

<p>
I considered myself no assassin, so I could not choose the infiltrator's life.
A scout could perhaps more easily search for her brother; but I could not
do this alone. Mother had taught us the songs and legends of our desert homeland,
and I thought those could prove useful here in the north. So I was sent to the
minstrel master to learn my trade. He welcomed me into the minstrel guild and
gave me a Lute of the Initiate with which to study. He showed me some simple
chords to urge people to greater swiftness and healing, and taught me a secret
shout with the power to harm.

I practiced my skills on the bandits in the area, but decided in the end to
return to Prydwen to replenish my very empty wallet. The journey back went
much faster than the journey from, thanks to the clear skies and the traveling
song I'd been taught.
