Arthur's death had left his once-proud kingdom broken into three warring realms,
the eldritch elves and witches of Hybernia, the warrior creatures of Midgard and the
pious legions of Albion. Now each realm must battle the other for control of all.
<p>Into this dark time comes a Saracen maiden who with song, sword and her own
wits must make her way through the troubles to the time of peace that few now ever
hope to see, in search of her brother, the last of their line.
