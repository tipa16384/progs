<font size="+1"><b>Tarla in Prydwen Keep</b></font>

<p>
I followed the west road out of Ludlow. The guards at the tower
outside of town were watchful, and I followed another guard to
the edge of the Black Mountains, where I took leave of him and
walked into the Camelot Hills.

<p>
Plague spiders overran the place; I killed those I saw. A dyemaster
walked about looking for the bits he needed to make new colors. I nodded
to him as I passed, and promised to keep for him any dye components I could find.
Perhaps he could mix me a color nobody has before seen.

Night fell and the moon lit the broken clouds as they raced across
the sky, letting through glimpses of the fixed stars which I
used to guide me on my way. The marker stone for Camelot 
rose out
of the darkness, with an arrow pointing past it to Prydwen Keep. I
started running, then; would Ahmid be glad to see his sister, or would
he rush immediately to Father's side?

<p>
The Keep
was built atop a rocky hill and I ran lightly up the path.
It was a place of solid stone, and I could not think of what
army could harm this place. I bound my essence to the place and asked
for word of my brother. The people there, though, had voice for only
one concern - the undead rising from the cemetary nearby.

<p>
A cleric implored me to put to rest the remains of a man named Mugrot.
What can a rogue do, hardly trained in her art?
Only her best, and thus I set out for the cemetary.
Puny skeletons rose against me but my flint dirk made short work of
them. Decayed zombies yearned for my brains but died to my blade.
At night though I saw a zombie larger than the rest and knew I had
found my prey. I could not defeat him; he was too powerful for me.
Still, I had given my word, and vowed to end this threat to the peace
of Prydwen Keep. Only hubris could help. And so he did, taking the
blows from this fearsome creature as I flensed his crawling flesh from his
rotted bones. I thanked Hubris; he suggested the belt found amongst
the carnage might have some small magic attached to it; I put it on
and felt the magic of animation run through my body.

<p>

The threat vanquished, I asked the people of Prydwen if they had seen
a Saracen come by with a ready smile and a song in his heart, but they
would only admit to seeing a number of people recently who were being
sent to the Midgard front. Some of them were Saracen, and perhaps
one had been dear Ahmid, but not a one were smiling.

<p>
They warned me I was not strong enough to journey so far, but perhaps
I could take service with Prydwen? My search, though, drew me on.
I stayed to help the good people of Prydwen Keep kill the other undead.
They sometimes dropped tattered armor; not in the best condition
but certainly better protection than what I had. I soon was well
protected, with enough money to perhaps buy better armor.

<p>
The armorers in Prydwen Keep did not have the style of armor I liked,
so I decided to return to Ludlow and see what the armorer there had
available. Perhaps there I could finish my study of the roguish art
and decide where to look next for my brother.
