26th level Bard of Hibernia</b>

<p>Tarla is wearing pretty nice gear. Her coral vest came from the mermen in Connla's Well.
Her pants are Empyrean Mist Leggings, part of her epic quest. Her boots are gilded boots
from a Connla quest. Her cloak is a guild cloak, she swaps in her Marvelous Cloak
(from Muire's Tomb) when needed. Her sword is an Earthen Defender from the Spraggon Den.

<b><font size=+2>Etha Kuroikashi</font><br>
17th level Enchantress of Hibernia</b>

<p>The first picture shows Etha with her companion, Jane (they're just really good friends.
Really.) As guild tailor, she wears what she makes and is her own advertisement. Black
is one of the colors of wealth in DAoC, so naturally she wears it as a sign saying to all
who see her, "Take advantage of me! I have money!".

<p>The second picture shows her turned a little so you can see her guild cloak, with
the insignia of the Black Oak (her guild) on the back. You can only wear the insignia if
you're over level 20 or have extremely high crafting skills (400+). Since she is only 17,
it's another advertisement for her skills. Don't buy from anyone else!
